| Day                          | Part 1 | Part 2 | Thoughts
|------------------------------|--------|--------|----------
| [1](src/solutions/day1.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | As with most early advent of code challenges, it's mostly parsing strings. 
| [2](src/solutions/day2.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Again, 90% of the work is parsing strings. While doing part 1 I parsed them to a nice data structure that ended up being overkill for part 2, sadly. 
| [3](src/solutions/day3.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | A difficulty spike from day 2. First challenge where the algorithm is actually harder than the input parsing. 
| [4](src/solutions/day4.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Much easier than day 3. Very fun challenge overall. 
| [5](src/solutions/day5.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Pretty fun challenge. Part 1 was fairly easy, part 2 took some debugging to get right. Curiously, I later tried a brute-force solution, and it "only" takes 18 seconds on my cpu. 
| [6](src/solutions/day6.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Simple and elegant problem, with a simple and elegant solution.
| [7](src/solutions/day7.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | A bit boring, in that the challenge is simple but requires quite a bit of writing to solve. Not too hard otherwise. 
| [8](src/solutions/day8.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Very interesting problem, very poorly stated. Part 1 is great. Part 2, however, requires you making a some assumptions that are not at all stated. 
| [9](src/solutions/day9.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Found this one to be very easy, part 1 and 2 being basically the same. Fun challenge nonetheless.
