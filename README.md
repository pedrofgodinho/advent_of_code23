| Day                          | Part 1 | Part 2 | Thoughts
|------------------------------|--------|--------|----------
| [1](src/solutions/day1.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | As with most early advent of code challenges, it's mostly parsing strings. 
| [2](src/solutions/day2.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | Again, 90% of the work is parsing strings. While doing part 1 I parsed them to a nice data structure that ended up being overkill for part 2, sadly. 
| [3](src/solutions/day3.rs)   |   ‚≠ê   |   ‚≠ê   | A difficulty spike from day 2. First challenge where the algorithm is actually harder than the input parsing.
